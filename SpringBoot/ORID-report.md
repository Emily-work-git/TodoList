### ORID Report - Emily

#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
Today's session mainly focused on Axios Interceptor and CORS. We learned how to use Axios Interceptor to inject headers and modify request and response metadata. This is useful for global exception handling and ensuring smooth communication between frontend and backend. We also explored CORS and its solutions to address CORS warnings in the backend. As a wrap-up of our learnings, we also created a concept map for React, summarizing the key concepts and components we have covered in the past few days.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
Today's session on Axios Interceptor and CORS was quite informative. I found it interesting to learn how to use Axios Interceptor to inject headers and modify request and response metadata. Understanding the concept of CORS and how to solve CORS warnings in the backend was also valuable. Creating a concept map for React as a wrap-up of what we have learned in these days also help me to connect what i have learnt better.

#### Interpretive: Why?
Learning about Axios Interceptor and CORS is important for building robust and secure web applications. By using Axios Interceptor, we can easily handle global exception handling and modify request and response metadata as per our requirements. I used to inject header directly to request before learning Axios Interceptor, yet I found my approach is not a suitable solution for global header injection. It is good to know that we can use Axios Interceptor for more global request-response related operation. Creating a concept map for React also help me solidify my understanding of React and its key concepts.

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
Based on today's learning, I plan to implement Axios Interceptor in my future projects to handle global exception handling and modify request and response metadata efficiently. I will also explore different techniques to solve CORS warnings in the backend. Additionally, I will create a comprehensive concept map for React, summarizing the key concepts and components we have learned so far.
